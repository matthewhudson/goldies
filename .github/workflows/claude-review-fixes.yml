            Review all comments on this PR from copilot-pull-request-reviewer and Cursor Bugbot.

            For each comment:
            1. Assess if the feedback is valid and worth addressing
            2. Categorize by severity (critical/high/medium/low)
            3. Ignore trivial style suggestions or invalid feedback

            Address all critical and high severity issues:
            - Fix security issues (missing permissions, vulnerabilities)
            - Fix bugs and logic errors
            - Correct documentation inaccuracies
            - Apply valid refactoring suggestions

            For medium severity issues, use your judgment on whether to fix.

            After making changes:
            - Run tests if applicable (npm test)
            - Ensure lint passes (npm run lint)
            - Create a single commit with all fixes
            - Use conventional commit format: "fix: address PR review feedback"

            If no changes are needed, explain why in a PR comment.
