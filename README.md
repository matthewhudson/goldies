# Goldies - "Good Oldies"

> A wide-ranging collection of JavaScript helpers covering debugging,
> de-/serialization, sanitization, validation, HTTP requests and more that have
> helped me on more than one occasion.

## Background

The code and other tools here serve as my own personal reference point. In some
cases, they're URL tools, or DOM helpers. But more often than not, they're tinny
chunks of code I've forgotten and had to lookup on Google or StackOverflow.

Plan is to keep them here, as ES6 modules, with tests/benchmark/notes when
appropriate.

## Additional Resources

These are development tools and services I've found useful previously, and don't
want to forget about.
