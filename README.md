# Goldies - "Good Oldies"

> My grab bag of helpful JavaScript & tidbits.

## Background

The code and other tools here serve as my own personal reference points. In some
cases, they're URL tools, or DOM helpers. But more often than not, they're tiny
chunks of code I've forgotten and had to lookup on Google or StackOverflow.

Plan is to keep them here and add tests/benchmark/notes when appropriate.

## Additional Resources

These are development tools and services I've found useful previously, and don't
want to forget about.
